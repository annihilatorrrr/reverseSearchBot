Finds the source of an image/GIF/sticker/video or identify the anime character, show, episode & time from its screenshot. Also works in groups if you reply to an image with commands "/source" and "/sauce". Use the inline mode for URL lookups and sharing the sauce with buttons.

Scrapes from ~~Tineye~~ (fuck) and Saucenow. Doesn't use the standard API.
